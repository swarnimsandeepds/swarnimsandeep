## 🧭 **About Me**
I’m a Product & Customer Success professional with experience across AI platforms, forecasting systems, B2B SaaS, and GTM operations.  
I specialize in transforming messy datasets, user interviews, and market signals into **clear product strategy, scalable processes, and customer-facing value.**

My background spans:
- Product Management (AI, automation, forecasting, D2C SaaS)  
- Customer Success (onboarding, renewals, health scoring, playbooks)  
- GTM Strategy (enablement, positioning, lifecycle workflows)  
- AI workflow design (RAG systems, n8n, Pinecone, AWS, automation)

I’ve worked with early-stage teams, research labs, founders, and enterprise stakeholders to build products that are both technically sound and customer-obsessed.
